## General info
This is a personal passion project to help me gain a better understanding of the APIs that I encounter at work on the daily. 

## Technologies / Setup 
VSCode as a code editor, SQLite and DB browser to help manage my mock database.  

## Inspiration
Working with APIs in my day job as a performance/digital marketer is what inspired this project. 
Do note that I have no formal training and no computer science degree.
